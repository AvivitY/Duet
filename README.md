# Duet
This project connects between people who loves music. The main concept of the application is finding a match/love based on the music taste of the person.

The first screen is the login screen:

The user can either connect through spotify or with a regular email account.
After the user signs in the home page is displayed:

The user can either press "like" (heart) or "dislike" (x).
When the user press "dislike" the match candidate changes and they will not be displayed again.
When the user press "like" the match candidate also changed and if the match candidate also pressed like beforehand a match pop up will be displayed:
